### Setting Up a Project

Install the Angular CLI globally:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Download or clone the code from this repository.

If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

```
git clone https://github.com/BrenoRev/FrontEnd_CarRent.git
```

Navigate to the Application folder

```
cd [PROJECT NAME]

```

In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type npm install.

```
npm install

```

This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.

In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type npm start.

```
npm start

```
The application should then compile and launch in your default browser.
